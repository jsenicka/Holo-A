Notwithstanding the foregoing, VMware will have no obligation under this Section 8 or otherwise with respect to any claim based on: (a) a combination of Software with non-VMware products (other than non-VMware products that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use of any older version of the Software when use of a newer VMware revision would have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software made without VMware’s express written approval; (e) any claim that relates to open source software or freeware technology or any derivatives or other adaptations thereof that is not embedded by VMware into Software listed on VMware’s commercial price list; (f) any claim that relates to Linux or Android open source software, even when it has been embedded into or distributed with the Software or (g) any Software provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis.

Recipient may use Confidential Information of Discloser; (a) to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this EULA; or (b) in connection with the parties’ ongoing business relationship. Recipient will not use any Confidential Information of Discloser for any purpose not expressly permitted by the EULA, and will disclose the Confidential Information of Discloser only to the employees or contractors of Recipient who have a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of the EULA and who are under a duty of confidentiality no less restrictive than Recipient’s duty hereunder. Recipient will protect Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as Recipient protects its own confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care.

Recipient’s obligations under Section 11.2 with respect to any Confidential Information will terminate if Recipient can show by written records that such information: (a) was already known to Recipient at the time of disclosure by Discloser; (b) was disclosed to Recipient by a third party who had the right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality restrictions; (c) is, or through no fault of Recipient has become, generally available to the public; or (d) was independently developed by Recipient without access to, or use of, Discloser’s Information. In addition, Recipient will be allowed to disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or by the order of a court of similar judicial or administrative body, provided that Recipient notifies Discloser of such required disclosure promptly and in writing and cooperates with Discloser, at Discloser’s request and expense, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.
